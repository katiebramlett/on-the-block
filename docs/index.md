## Welcome to On The Block

### What is On The Block?
On the Block, our Ethereum-based decentralized application, is a streamlined payment portal which can be used to set up timely rental payments.<br>
Built on Ethereum smart contract technology, On The Block offers numerous benefits to landlords and tenants, including traceability, security, efficiency, fairness, and transparency.<br>
Real-world rental contracts often go through a third party intermediary to exchange payment from the tenant to the landlord, which leaves room for error with safety, security, and fairness. With On The Block, landlords and tenants will be guaranteed a quick, safe, and fair contract.<br>

On The Block offers user-friendly and efficent features:
1. Start New Rental Contracts
2. Check Existing Rental Contracts
3. Terminate Existing Rental Contracts
4. Get Easy Notifications

Fueled by the heightened demand for blockchain technology, the Ethereum smart contracts market is rapidly growing. Itâ€™s easier than ever before to integrate blockchain technology with user-friendly applications. This applies beyond just On The Block. There are endless possibilities of where our technology could be used beyond rental agreements.

Get SMART with your rental contracts, and visit On The Block today.
