### What is On The Block?
**On the Block**, our Ethereum-based decentralized application, is a streamlined payment portal which can be used to set up timely rental payments.<br>

Real-world rental contracts often go through a third party intermediary to exchange payment from the tenant to the landlord, which leaves room for error with safety, security, and fairness. Built on Ethereum smart contract technology, **On The Block** offers numerous benefits to landlords and tenants, including traceability, security, efficiency, fairness, and transparency. With **On The Block**, landlords and tenants will be guaranteed a quick, safe, and fair contract.<br>

On The Block offers user-friendly and efficent features:<br>

Fueled by the heightened demand for blockchain technology, the Ethereum smart contracts market is rapidly growing. It’s easier than ever before to integrate blockchain technology with user-friendly applications. This applies beyond just **On The Block**. There are endless possibilities of where our technology could be used beyond rental agreements.

Get **SMART** with your rental contracts, and visit On The Block today.

Hi I’m Katie!<br>
I am currently pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science at George Washington University (Class of 2022) in Washington, DC. I am interested in a career in cybersecurity and software engineering.<br>
Following graduation this May, I will be returning home to Boston, MA. There, I’ll be taking a full-time role at Raytheon Technologies as a Cyber Design Engineer, while also pursuing a M.S. in Cybersecurity at Northeastern University. I am passionate about empowering women in STEM and I’m eager to take a future leadership role, after building a strong technical foundation.<br>
Additionally, I love to play soccer, stay active, hike, cook, explore new restaurants and locations around the city, and spend time with friends and family. I am so excited for my next chapter in Boston!<br>
